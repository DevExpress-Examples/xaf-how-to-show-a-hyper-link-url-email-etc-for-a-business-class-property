# XAF - How to show a hyper link (URL, email, etc.) for a business class property

 This example shows custom [Property Editors](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113097/ui-construction/view-items-and-property-editors/property-editors) that provide access to object fields with an email address or URL as clickable text.

To validate a URL, these editors use a combined `RexEx` mask. The default regular expression is:

```
(((http|https|ftp)\://)?[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(:[a-zA-Z0-9]*)?/?([a-zA-Z0-9\-\._\?\,\'/\\\+&amp;%\$#\=~])*)|([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6})
```

You can use it as is or modify it per your specific needs. Search for [Regular Expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) in MSDN for more information on how to do this.
A double click opens a URL in DetailView of the WinForms project for end-user convenience.

These editors are created for learning purposes only. You can extend them or create your own editors to meet your business needs.
